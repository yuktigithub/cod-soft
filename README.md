# codsoft internship task description.
## Task-1: Number game!
### 1. Objective: 
The player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range.

### 2. Game Flow:
. The game generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
. The player is prompted to input their guess.
. The game provides hints (like "too high" or "too low") based on the comparison between the guessed number and the generated number.
. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the random number.
### 3. Outcomes:
If the player guesses the number correctly, they win.
If the player exceeds a certain number of attempts without guessing correctly, the game might end.
This game is a simple yet effective way to practice programming logic and user interaction. It involves generating random numbers, user input handling, conditional statements for comparison, and a loop to manage multiple guesses until the correct number is found.

## Task-2: Student grade calculator!
### 1. Input Marks: 
Enter marks (out of 100) for each subject.
### 2. Total Marks: 
Add up all subject marks for the total.
### 3. Average Percentage:
Divide the total marks by the number of subjects for the average percentage.
### 4. Grade Assignment: 
Assign a grade based on the average percentage achieved.
### 5. Display Results:
Show total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to understand academic performance.

This calculator helps students track their overall performance, calculate their average percentage, and interpret their academic standing through assigned grades. It simplifies understanding by presenting a comprehensive view of their performance across subjects.

## Task-1: Number game!
### 1. Objective: 
The player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range.

### 2. Game Flow:
. The game generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
. The player is prompted to input their guess.
. The game provides hints (like "too high" or "too low") based on the comparison between the guessed number and the generated number.
. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the random number.
### 3. Outcomes:
If the player guesses the number correctly, they win.
If the player exceeds a certain number of attempts without guessing correctly, the game might end.
This game is a simple yet effective way to practice programming logic and user interaction. It involves generating random numbers, user input handling, conditional statements for comparison, and a loop to manage multiple guesses until the correct number is found.

## Task-2: Student grade calculator!
### 1. Input Marks: 
Enter marks (out of 100) for each subject.
### 2. Total Marks: 
Add up all subject marks for the total.
### 3. Average Percentage:
Divide the total marks by the number of subjects for the average percentage.
### 4. Grade Assignment: 
Assign a grade based on the average percentage achieved.
### 5. Display Results:
Show total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to understand academic performance.

This calculator helps students track their overall performance, calculate their average percentage, and interpret their academic standing through assigned grades. It simplifies understanding by presenting a comprehensive view of their performance across subjects.

## Task 3: Currency Converter
### Overview
This currency converter is a simple tool built using Java that allows users to convert currency values between Indian Rupees (INR) and other specific countries without relying on a paid Exchange Rate API. It's designed to demonstrate a basic currency conversion functionality using a predefined map of country codes and their respective currencies.

### Features
Conversion: Users can convert a specific amount from INR to the currency of a selected country.
Supported Countries: Limited set of countries included in the converter due to the predefined mapping.

## How to Use
### Setup:
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
### Run the Program:
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
Locate the CurrencyConverter.java file and run it.
### Using the Converter:
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the amount in INR and select the target country by its country code.
The program will display the converted amount in the selected country's currency.
### Limitations
Static Mapping: The converter relies on a predefined mapping of country codes and currencies, limiting its scope to specific countries.
Real-Time Rates: This tool does not fetch real-time exchange rates but uses a fixed mapping for demonstration purposes.
### Contributing
Contributions and improvements are welcome! If you have ideas to enhance this converter or expand its functionality, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and create a pull request.

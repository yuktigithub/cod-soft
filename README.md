# codsoft internship task description.
Task-1: Number game!
# Explaination: 
# 1. Objective: 
The player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a specific range.

# 2. Game Flow:
. The game generates a random number within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
. The player is prompted to input their guess.
. The game provides hints (like "too high" or "too low") based on the comparison between the guessed number and the generated number.
. The player continues guessing until they correctly identify the random number.
# 3. Outcomes:
If the player guesses the number correctly, they win.
If the player exceeds a certain number of attempts without guessing correctly, the game might end.
This game is a simple yet effective way to practice programming logic and user interaction. It involves generating random numbers, user input handling, conditional statements for comparison, and a loop to manage multiple guesses until the correct number is found.
